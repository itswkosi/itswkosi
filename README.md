Hey! 
I'm Shemmy, an aspiring bioinformatician.

I'm very interested in biological computing, genomics, computer science and artificial intelligence. I'm currently exploring how to use artificial intelligence to discover and diagnose rare genetic diseases via phenotype-genotype links.

Outside of school, I enjoy dance and cheer, as well as coding and playing video games and building robots.

Let's connect!
